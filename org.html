        <h1>Puppy Mills</h1>
        <p>
          PussyLoversUnited opposes “puppy mills,” facilities and individuals who mass-produce puppies for the pet shop industry, online selling, or other retail purposes. Puppy mills suffer from poor oversight, control, and regulation. Ill health, genetic defects and/or negative behavior traits are often overlooked in favor of financial profit. The dogs used for breeding purposes are often insufficiently cared for, inhumanely housed, and lacking adequate veterinary care.

        <h1>Retail Sale of Pets</h1>
        <p>PussyLoversUnited <span><strong>Adopt, Don’t Shop.</strong></span>. We strongly discourage people from buying cats and dogs from pet shops and breeders. We encourage them to adopt from the shelter instead. Pet shops are the primary customers of puppy mills. If the individual chooses to buy a specific breed of dog, we encourage him to seek out reputable breeders dedicated to improving the health, condition and behavior of their animals.</p>

        <h1>Animal Fighting</h1>
        <p>PussyLoversUnited opposes any acts whereby humans incite, allow, or cause animals to fight. Dogfighting, cockfighting, and bullfighting are examples of animal “blood-sports,” which glorify violence for the sake of monetary gain, entertainment, or other purposes. These activities cause suffering, maiming, and death to the animals forced to participate, and they have negative social consequences. Dogfighting and horsefighting are illegal under the Animal Welfare Act. Cockfighting is still legal, but PAWS will continue to campaign actively against ANY form of animal fighting.</p>

          PussyLoversUnited believes that working animals must be treated with consideration and must be given adequate care, shelter, food and water. They must not be overworked or overloaded, nor must they be forced to work through ill-treatment.
