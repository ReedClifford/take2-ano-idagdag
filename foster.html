        <p>
          Fostering saves lives. The foster home program is the best way to
          rescue an animal. It is also an opportunity for anyone who wants
          animal companionship but cannot commit to adopting.

        <h1>How can I rescue by fostering?</h1>
        <p>Often, people come to the shelter to admit a rescued cat or dog, but we are forced to turn them away due to lack of space. However, if these people agree to foster their rescued animal (or another shelter animal), then we are able to free up space and save another life.</p>

          <h1>What are the requirements?</h1>
          <p>Do you have enough room in your house to keep a cat or dog indoors? Are you willing to administer medicine to a sick animal, if necessary? Will you be able to bring it to the vet when the need arises?</p>

        <div class="box3">
          <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
          <p>PussyLoversUnited will provide veterinary services for FREE, and if possible, some food and medicine as well. However, foster parents may need to shoulder some of the costs as there may be shortages at times. Please remember that PussyLoversUnited is solely dependent on donations.</p>

        <div class="box4">
          <h1>How long is the foster period?</h1>
          <p>A foster parent must be prepared to care for their foster pet for at least 6 months. This is to ensure that the animal has recovered from any sickness, and has been vaccinated. Itâ€™s best if they are spayed/neutered as well before getting admitted to the shelter.</p>
